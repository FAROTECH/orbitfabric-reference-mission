# OrbitFabric Reference Mission

<div class="orbitfabric-lead" markdown>

**A contract-oriented engineering reference mission for OrbitFabric Core and OrbitFabric Studio.**

This site shows how a representative small-spacecraft mission can move from operational intent to a structured Mission Data Contract, deterministic Core evidence and visual engineering understanding in Studio.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **Understand the mission and the method**

    Start with the purpose, scope and recommended reading path before entering the progressive model construction.

    [Orientation →](00-orientation/00-purpose-and-reading-path.md)

-   **Follow the complete engineering tutorial**

    Build the contract progressively through mission context, modes, telemetry, commands, events, faults, payloads, data products and commandability.

-   **Inspect the current validated mission**

    Jump directly to the consolidated current-state overview when you already understand the tutorial structure and want the final mission picture.

    [Reference overview →](03-reference-overview/00-current-reference-mission-overview.md)

-   **Explore the mission in Studio**

    Follow the real OrbitFabric Studio Preview 1 workflow from mission opening to Entity X-Ray, explicit relationships, FDIR context and operational logic.

## The engineering arc

```text
mission need
-> model construction
-> scenario behavior
-> generated evidence
-> runtime-facing contract bindings
-> ground-facing integration artifacts
-> Core-owned structured surfaces
-> capability coverage review
-> Studio mission understanding
```

The Reference Mission is intentionally **contract-level**. It is not flight software, not a spacecraft simulator, not an RF simulator, not a ground segment and not mission control.

!!! info "Semantic authority stays in Core"
    The Mission Model defines the source contract. OrbitFabric Core validates, computes and emits authoritative structured facts and evidence. OrbitFabric Studio consumes and renders those facts for human inspection; it does not create a second interpretation of the mission semantics.

## What the reference demonstrates

| Area | Current reference coverage |
|---|---|
| Mission contract | Spacecraft identity, subsystem topology, operational modes, telemetry, commands, events, faults, payloads, data products, contact/downlink intent and commandability/autonomy. |
| Executable evidence | Four deterministic scenarios covering nominal acquisition, low-power protection, ADCS-degraded protection and delayed downlink backlog. |
| Core inspection surfaces | Model Summary, Mission Snapshot, Entity Index, Relationship Manifest, dashboard/scenario-index/coverage surfaces and explicit FDIR relationship families. |
| Generated integration artifacts | Runtime-facing C++17 contract bindings plus ground-facing dictionaries and review artifacts. |
| Studio Preview 1 | Mission Atlas, Entity Explorer, Entity X-Ray, Relations/Context Map, Validation Findings, Operational State Map and Mode Focus. |

## Current scenario set

| Scenario | Evidence focus |
|---|---|
| `nominal_payload_acquisition` | Nominal acquisition, histogram generation, S-band downlink and return to nominal. |
| `eclipse_low_power_payload_suspension` | EPS low-power warning, degraded-power posture and autonomous payload stop. |
| `adcs_degraded_pointing_payload_inhibit` | ADCS degraded pointing, ADCS-degraded posture and autonomous payload stop. |
| `delayed_sband_downlink_backlog_pending` | Histogram generated, S-band idle and backlog explicitly pending. |

## Release posture represented here

The tutorial deliberately distinguishes:

```text
v1.0.0
  Stable Mission Data Contract baseline

v1.1.0
  Published candidate integration surface consolidation

current post-v1.1 Core development
  candidate Mission Snapshot
  additive explicit FDIR relationship families
```

The Studio section targets **OrbitFabric Studio 0.15.0 Preview 1** and documents only implemented behavior.

## Studio publication set

The final tutorial block uses five real Studio captures from this Reference Mission:

```text
Mission Atlas
Entity X-Ray for eps.low_battery_warning
low-power FDIR Context Map
Operational State Map
Mode Focus for PAYLOAD_ACTIVE
```

The figures are selected and cropped for editorial clarity while remaining faithful to the real Studio surface and Core-owned mission facts.
